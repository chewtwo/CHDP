Folk architecture is considered as the oldest building in China. It usually has many forms, having no restrictions and built on the
basis of local conditions. As a country with a vast territory and a long history, China has a variety of natural and social 
environment. Therefore, residential styles vary from one place to another, such as the quadrangle dwellings in Beijing, the cave 
dwellings ion the Loess Plateau in Shaanxi Province and Hakka soil buildings in Fujian Province. These ancient building types have 
their own unique functions. Folks houses not only serve as living buildings, but also reflect different customs, and tell different 
life stories.
